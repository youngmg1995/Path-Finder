# Path-Finder
React App for Visualizing Path-finding Algorithms

## Overview

Path-Finder is a single page web-app bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) that serves as tool for visualizing various path-finding algorithms. I decided to build this project while learning Javascript for the first time in order to put the new language to use and as a nice way of reviewing some of the algorithms I learned long ago. The app can be reached using the following link- [Path-Finder](https://youngmg1995.github.io/Path-Finding-App/), which can also be saved to your home screen for easy access later. If you like and enjoy the game, please star/follow the page and consider contributing to the project.
